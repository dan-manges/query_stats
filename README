= Query Stats Plugin

The Query Stats plugin helps track database queries and performance.  It helps
developers know the performance of their interaction with databases without
constantly watching the logs.

== Requirements

* Rails >= 1.2

== Usage

Use the "queries" helper or controller method to access data on the queries.
See the documentation on QueryStats::Holder for functionality.

You can easily display statistics in your page footer, such as:
  Queries in Controller: <%= queries.count_with_label :controller %>
  Queries in View:       <%= queries.count_with_label :view %>
  Query Time:            <%= queries.runtime %>

== Logging

QueryStats adds the number of queries to the log in the DB section:
  Completed in 0.00642 (155 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 0.00228 (35%) | DB: 0.00247 (38%) 6 queries | 200 OK [http://test.host/]
