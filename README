= Query Stats Plugin

The Query Stats plugin helps track database queries and performance.  It helps
developers know the performance of their interaction with databases without
constantly watching the logs.

== Installation

The plugin will automatically modify active record and add a helper named "queries" to access the QueryStatsHolder.

One common use of Query Stats is to track queries executed in the controller separate from those executed in the view.
Often queries executed in the view indicate an opportunity to use eager loading for performance benefits.

If you would like to automatically label queries as to whether they were executed in the controller or the view, include QueryStats in your ApplicationController.

Example:
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include QueryStats
  end
  
== Usage

Call the "queries" helper or controller method to access data on the queries.
  Example: queries.total_time
See the methods available on QueryStatsHolder for functionality.

If you include QueryStats in your controller, you can easily display statistics at the end of your layout, such as:
  queries.count_with_label :controller
  queries.count_with_label :view
  queries.total_time
  
(If you do not wait until the end, you will not capture all the view queries)
